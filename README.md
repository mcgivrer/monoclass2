# README

A **MonoClass 2** project test.

This _small_ Java project with only one (master) class is a proof-of-concept of an over simplified java program to
deliver maximum feature in a minimum number lines of code, and WITHOUT dependencies out of the JDK itself.

A second challenge is in the no use for a build tool (maven or gradle) but nothing else than the JDK compiler tool and
the magic of a bash script (Back to Roots !).

And a last constrain is to reduce as much as possible the number of LoC, using enhancement from latest JDK.

Below a draft timeline of the project from creation to today. To be Continued !

Have fun discover this beast of code, to learn and take benefits of some latest JDK features (like
the [pattern matching for switch](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/406 "ssee the official specification")), and moreover,
overuse of lambda and stream each time this was possible.

## Build

Relying an a custom build script, just execute:

```shell
$> scripts/build.sh a
```

> :blue_book: _**NOTE**_
> _for curious people, you can experiment the following command line :
> `$> build h`
> getting help in this cli build script._

This will build a jar in `target/` directory.

## Run it !

You can run it by executing the following command line :

```shell
$> scripts/build.sh r
```

(see [Build V3 README](https://gist.github.com/mcgivrer/a31510019029eba73edf5721a93c3dec#file-readme-md) for details on
build script)

Or if you build it with `scripts/build.sh a`, you will be able to run it with :

```shell
$> java --enable-preview -jar target/monoclass2-1.0.3.jar
```

You will get the following window
